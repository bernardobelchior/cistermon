# CISTERMON - Building-Wide Smart Sensor Deployment

## Goal

This project was developed as the final assignment of my Summer Internship at the [Reasearch Center in Real-Time & Embedded Systems ](https://www.cister.isep.ipp.pt/). Its main purpose was to allow the administration to visualize and analyze the environment in the building's rooms.
The goal of this dashboard is to provide, in a user-friendly way, a system to analyze the institution's spending in heating and cooling the building all year round. 

## State

The project is in a usable state, but lacks the testing to ensure reliability. Bear in mind this project was only develop over a two month period.
